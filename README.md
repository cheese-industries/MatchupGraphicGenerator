# MatchupGraphicGenerator
A JavaScript utility to create 16x9 graphics for any NFL matchup

# Installation
There isn't any installation necessary. Unzip the file and open index.html in a browser.

# But I don't like the graphics!
Then you can make your own. There are subdirectories full of graphics - feel free to replace the ones that are provided. I did the best I could with what I had.

# It's 2027 and you haven't updated with the new logos!
I dunno what to tell you. I have a lot going on. Feel free to make your own and add them. The code in index.html and script.js should be pretty easy to figure out, even if you're not a coder.
